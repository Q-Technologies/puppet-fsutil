# puppet-local_users
Puppet module containing some useful routines.

## Issues
This module is using hiera data that is embedded in the module rather than using a params class.  This may not play nicely with other modules using the same technique unless you are using hiera 3.0.6 and above (PE 2015.3.2+).
